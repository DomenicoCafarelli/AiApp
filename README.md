## Code Documentation

Our project was built with SwiftUI Framework 

1. The first step is to import the Framework

```swift
import SwiftUI
```

2. Then we have to create the ContentView() to build our view

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        
    }
}
```

At this point we will receive an error just because our body is empty, so to avoid this we have to put something inside. 

3. Letâ€™s put inside the body a VStack{} 

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // put inside the elements that you would like to show vertically
        }
    }
}
```
